# Big O notation

BigO notaion is used to measure how running time or space requirements 
for your program grows as input size grows.

## Rule for Big O notation is  

- If we draw a graph between time and size of array and it forms
a linear line , then the formula will be  an+b 

So to specify the time taken by as program to process and array of size n will be 

time = a*(n)+b where a and b are constant

Rule is to 

1. Keep the fastest growing term
   that is; a*n

2. Drop any constant

3. Then the time req will be O(n).
4. So we say that the time taken by this prgram is  Order of N
